## About the Project

NAYA was born from the idea that travelers often need a reliable space to share their experiences and get inspired by others.  
The project was developed as part of the **Holberton School Portfolio Project**.

The goal was to offer:

- A clear and intuitive interface designed to present the product  
- Content that highlights the technical work achieved in the main application  
- A complete static page accessible without any login requirement
